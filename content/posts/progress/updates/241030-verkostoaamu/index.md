I was invited by the [Ruokavirasto](https://maaseutu.fi)
Rural Network Support Unit of Finland to give a presentation about Hansalim at their regular [webinar](https://maaseutuverkosto.fi/sv/evenemang/natverksmorgon-verkostoaamu-goes-in-english-hansalim-a-south-korean-concept-for-selling-and-marketing-local-products/) for rural development actors. Thomas Snellman of Reko also took part to share his thoughts about Hansalim following on from his visit in May 2024.

Following the presentation I wrote a blog post for the Rural Network Support Unit website which is available to read [here](https://maaseutu.fi/blogi/hansalim-etela-korean-solidaarisuuteen-perustuva-kestava-ruokajarjestelma/).

And subsequently, the recording of the webinar was posted on their website and on Youtube for anyone to watch (see link below).

Here is the blurb for the webinar:

> Learn more about Hansalim - a South Korean concept for selling and marketing local products. It began with a simple promise of mutual responsibility between consumers and producers. Now it is even a life movement, spread all over the country. Get inspired by researcher Jonathan Dolley and hear what Mr Reko in Finland Thomas Snellman says about this concept.
