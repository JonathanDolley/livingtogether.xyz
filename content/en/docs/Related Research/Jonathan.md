Hi I'm Dr Jonathan Dolley, a Research Fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), University of Sussex Business School. My research focuses on sustainable food systems in urbanised and rapidly urbanising countries with a focus on the role of co-operatives.

## Research projects

### DPhil Research

My DPhil research focused on China with a case study of an urban food system in Wuhan. The central research question was: 

> What are the implications for peri-urban producers of government policies to promote food system resilience and what are the lessons for enhancing sustainability and resilience in urban food systems?

My thesis concluded that the current approach to governance of Wuhan’s peri-urban vegetable system is building an increasingly exclusionary pattern of resilience. It is a form of resilience building which is likely to undermine broader sustainability goals around social justice and environmental integrity and have mixed future implications for food system resilience as a whole, particularly in relation to livelihood outcomes for peri-urban farmers and food safety outcomes for urban consumers in general.

The key lessons from this research are that the concept of resilience can be used to support either a narrowing down or an opening up of normative framings of system outcomes and can contribute to obscuring or revealing the multiple process of change unfolding across the levels of system context, structures and actors. These dualities in the way that resilience thinking can contribute to normative and analytical framings need to be explicitly acknowledged if serious unintended consequences of resilience building interventions are to be avoided.

### Postdoc research

#### Risks and Responses to Urban Futures (2015-2016):

As a research fellow on this ESPA (espa.ac.uk) funded transdisciplinary project with partners in India I was involved in analysing the connections between urbanisation, changes in peri-urban ecosystem services and experiences of poverty and health risks among peri-urban farmers.

#### STEPS Centre Urban Theme (2016-2017):

In this project I was part of a research team reflecting on and investigating how transdisciplinary research can contribute to challenging elite capture of urban development policy and democratising urban environmental agendas through working with alliances of poor and pro-poor actors over long periods across multiple research projects.

#### Understanding trade-offs between SDGs in urbanising contexts (2017 - 2019)

> Novel methods of mapping rural-urban interactions in food systems to analyse risks and opportunities for environmental and human health.

For this Sussex Sustainability Research Fund (SSRP) project I worked with our University's informatics department along with a wider team from across multiple schools to explore ways of integrating computational methods with transdisciplinary research for mapping, analysing and visually communicating the interactions between urbanisation, urban pollution, peri-urban food systems and human health in India and China.

#### Inclusive Green Infrastructures for Urban Well-being (2019 - 2021)

Project website: [agri-food-transformations.netlify.app](https://agri-food-transformations.netlify.app/)

The SSRP project led to a larger collaborative project with Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan and Jeweharlal Nehru University, Delhi and led by the University of Sussex.

It was an interdisciplinary research project funded by the [British Academy Urban Infrastructures of Well-being Programme](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/programmes/urban-infrastructures-well-being/). Our research explored the interactions between urbanisation and green infrastructures and implications for wellbeing in Wuhan, China and Ghaziabad, India. The project combined development of a web-app for land-use change analysis alongside fieldwork with peri-urban farmers and residents in the two cities.

The [web-app](https://landscapes.wearepal.ai/) provides a novel approach to combining deep learning techniques with visual image analysis to map land-use change across multiple scales using satellite imagery.

It is currently being used and further developed as part of a £12.5m pilot programme, ‘Nature-based Solutions for Climate Change at the Landscape Scale’. This is a Defra - BEIS project supported by the Treasury’s Shared Outcomes Fund and led by Natural England, Environment Agency, RBG Kew and the Forestry Commission.

#### SSRP Sustainability Search Database (2020 - 2021)

Web-app: [sussex.ac.uk/ssrp...](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-sustainability-research-programme/research-and-resources/mapping)

This project was an initiative by the [Sussex Sustainability search Programme (SSRP)](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-sustainability-research-programme/) with funding from the International Development Challenge Fund (IDCF), which is an internal funding mechanism financed by the University's Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF).

In consultation with Fiona Hurd and Fiona Marshall, I designed and built a web-app to perform text mining on data from the profiles of Sussex researchers and their publications to generate keywords and map these against the Sustainable Development Goals based on the [SIRIS SDG vocabulary](https://zenodo.org/record/4118028#.YZfcaL1ByrY).

To build the web-app I learnt R, SQL and Shiny and also learned about several text mining techniques.

#### Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action - Global Fellowship (2021 - present)

**Project title:** Hansalim as a model for solidarity pathways towards sustainable food systems.

This 3 year research project is led by Dr Jonathan Dolley and supervised by the University of Sussex and the Mosim and Salim Research Institute, Hansalim (South Korea).
