      Multi-stakeholder co-operatives (MSC) (or solidarity cooperatives) are defined as “co-operatives that formally allow for ownership and governance by representatives of two or more 'stakeholder' groups within the same organisation.”  In agri-food systems this usually means farmers and consumers, but can also include workers involved in other activities related to the food system (e.g.  processing and distribution). This novel arrangement is aimed at overcoming the conflict of interest between producers and consumers inherent in a capitalist market-driven food system. Among those calling for a transition to a more solidarity-based and public good focused economy (e.g. <a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/">P2P Foundation</a> and <a href="https://disco.coop/">DisCO Coop</a>) many have come to see this model of co-operation as an important vehicle for social and ecological transformation.  Yet there is very little research on MSCs, especially in the context in agri-food systems.

      Over 30 years ago, however, in South Korea an ecological alternative movement was born that nurtured an emerging alliance of MSCs that drove the growth of agroecological farming in that country despite aggressive agricultural industrialisation policies. In 1989 a group of Korean intellectuals published the <a href="http://www.mosim.or.kr/arc_list/3946">Hansalim Manifesto</a> which opposed the contemporary project of environmentally destructive socially oppressive industrialization and presented a radical vision of social and ecological transformation rooted in the Korean traditions of Confucian and Daoist thought.  Formed in the 1980s the Hansalim Movement which produced this manifesto rejected the Western mechanistic model of the universe and modernisation as mastery over nature.  It advocated an alternative development path, rooted in Eastern philosophy (specifically the Korean tradition of Donghak or ‘Eastern Learning’) which sought harmony with nature and advocated cooperation between farmers and urban populations seeking a way of harmoniously ‘living together’: human and human, human and nature.

      The movement adopted food as a symbol of the interconnectedness of humans and nature, forming a national association of organic food cooperatives with the goal of supporting symbiotic relationships between rural farmers and urban consumers. Over the following decades, Hansalim grew into the largest multi-stakeholder organic food cooperative in the world with a membership of 644,000 consumer households and 2,220 farming households in 2017, nearly 3% of the country's population.  The cooperative and its economic activities continues to sustain the ideological project of wider societal transformation through Hansalim's diverse collection of departments and alliances, even running its own research centre, the Mosim and Salim Research Institute (Mosim).

      Hansalim is a remarkable example of an MSC developing sufficient scale, complexity and diversity that it can sustain a large-scale alternative agri-food system even within a highly urbanised industrialised capitalist economy. This is rare if not unheard of in English-speaking academic literature on Alternative Food Networks (AFN) which focuses mainly on small-scale Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), producer cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in North America , Europe , Australia and China.

      In Korea Hansalim is the most prominent example of a number of MSCs in agri-food with memberships in the thousands and tens of thousands. Despite the apparent success of Hansalim's MSC model there has been no systematic attempt in the West to learn the lessons from the Korean experience or to share knowledge .
